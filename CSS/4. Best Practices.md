# Best Practices

There are a number of best-practices that we follow when writing CSS.

* 2 space indentation
* Use [BEM naming conventions and principles](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/16/a-new-front-end-methodology-bem/)
* Separate layout styles (floats, margin, padding) from decoration (color, background, type)
* Keep each module in it's own file or Component package
* Never do browser detection - use [feature detection](http://modernizr.com/) instead.
