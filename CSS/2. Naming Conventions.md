## BEM

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a way of writing CSS that is flexible and avoids many pitfalls
of the language. It suggests breaking up objects into 3 types:

### Blocks

There are the most outer elements. It could be '.Dialog', or '.Feature'. It is the parent
element of a module. Blocks are generally written with an uppercase letter.

### Element

Blocks have child elements that depend on them. For example. '.Dialog__close'. Elements are always
written in this format. The block comes first, followed by double underscore to indicate that it's
a sub-element of the parent block.

```css
.Dialog {}
.Dialog__content {}
.Dialog__close {}
```

If an element name contains two words, it should be *camel case*.

```css
.Dialog__closeButton
```

### Modifier

Often blocks and elements have different styles based on their state or importance. For example, a `Message`
block may have several states, `error`, `success`, or `warning`. These state are written like so:

```css
.Message {}
.Message--error {}
.Message--success {}
.Message--warning {}
```
