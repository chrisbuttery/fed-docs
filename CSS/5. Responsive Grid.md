# Responsive Grid

We use a responsive grid component to build all of the layouts on the site. This grid is used entirely with classes in the markup. This means we can keep the layout of pages separate from the other modules.

## Installation

Change into `bundles/common` and run:

```
component install nib-styles/responsive-grid
```

This will install the grid into the current component. Alternatively, just add the component as a dependency:

```
"dependencies": {
  "nib-styles/responsive-grid": "*"
}
```

## Documentation

You can [view the project on Github](https://github.com/nib-styles/responsive-grid) to read the documentation on how to use the grid.
